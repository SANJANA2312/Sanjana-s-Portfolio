# Sanjana-s-Portfolio

In this assignment I initially have created two files index.html and about.html.
now I have added CSS and JS to it.

In index.html I Introduced myself and gave a brief about my skillS which include HTML, Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Photoshop and CSS.
This also contains my contact information, that is my GitHub profile link and my email Id.

In about.html I have added about my projects done using Adobe Illustrator and Adobe Premiere Pro 2024.
Now I also updated added the picture of the logo that I created using Adobe Illustrator and a commercial script written by me.

For both the files, I run and debug the code and further I added the paths to both the files and made commits. I added various elements such as heading, lists, paragraph, heading, links, tables.

After learning CSS , I added the border to the table, highlighted my logo, highlighted my introduction section with dotted boundary.

Using Js I created the button , the greeting that the website shows changes according to time and added the ordered list.

Last but not the least, Health is wealth! Stay hydrated, Take care. :slightly_smiling_face: (github emoji cheatsheet google)
