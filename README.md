# Sanjana-s-Portfolio

In this assignment I have created two files index.html and about.html

In index.html I Introduced myself and gave a brief about my skillS which include HTML, Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Photoshop and CSS.
This also contains my contact information, that is my GitHub profile link and my email Id.

In about.html I have added about my projects done using Adobe Illustrator and Adobe Premiere Pro 2024.

For both the files, I run and debug the code and further I added the paths to both the files and made commits. I added various elements such as heading, lists, paragraph, heading, links, tables.
